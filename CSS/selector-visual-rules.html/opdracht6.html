      <p>Maak een voorbeeld van de volgende selectors</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="" Child Selectors></li></a>
        <li>Adjacent Selectors</li>
        <li>General Selectors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Child Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        A child selector matches when an element is the child of some element. A
        child selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by "&#62;".
      </p>

      <p>
        The following rule sets the style of all P elements that are children of
        BODY:
      </p>
      <code> body &#62; P { line-height: 1.3 } </code>
      <p>
        The following example combines descendant selectors and child selectors:
        div ol li p It matches a P element that is a descendant of an LI; the LI
        element must be the child of an OL element; the OL element must be a
        descendant of a DIV.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Adjacent Selector</h2>
        <p>
          Just two or more selectors separated by a plus (+) symbol. The
          simplest construction is two elements with a plus between them. The
          selected element will be the one immediately following the plus
          symbol, but only when following the element listed before the plus.
          For example:
        </p>
        <code> H1 + P {margin-top: 0;} </code>
        <p>
          The rule will apply to all paragraphs which immediately follow an H1
          element, and which share the same parent. That's where the name comes
          from: The elements must have the same parent element, which makes them
          siblings, and they must be adjacent to each other in the document
          tree.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
          <h3>General Selector</h3>
        
        <p>
             The general sibling selector allow the styling of an element that's a sibling of another
             this selctor are part of the family of combinator selector, you identified them with the tilde ~
             charachter
             Some example of the syntax:

        <code>
            h2 ~p{
                color:green;
            }

        </code>
        <p>
        This two elemets are on the same hierarchy level.It targets element on the same level
