      <h2>Inline Boxes</h2>
      <p>
        A block element occupies the entire space of its parent element, thereby
        creating a “block”.They stack on top of each other. They have a width of
        100%
        <br />
        Browsers typically display the block element with a newline both before
        and after the element.
        <br />
        By default, block elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can
        start anywhere in a line.
        <br />
        Block-level elements may contain inline elements.

        Inline boxes are laid out horizontally in a box called a line box: If
        there isn't enough horizontal space to fit all elements into a single
        line, another line box is created under the first one.
