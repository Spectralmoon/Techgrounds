      <h2>
        Er zijn 14 verschillende pseudo elementen. Je hebt in de voorgaande
        opdracht reeds 4 kunnen benoemen. Kun je de andere 10 ook benoemen en
        aangeven wat ze precies doen?
      </h2>
      <div>
        <h2>: checked</h2>
        <p>
          The :checked pseudo-class targets radio buttons, checkboxes and option
          elements that have been checked or selected.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>: hover</h2>
        <p>
          The :hover pseudo-class is used to style an element when the user’s
          pointer is above it. It doesn’t have to be restricted to links,
          although that is the most common use case.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>: invalid</h2>
        <p>
          The :invalid pseudo-class targets a form element whose formatting is
          not correct according to that element’s required format. In the
          following example, when the email input field has an incorrectly
          formatted email structure, the value would be considered invalid, and
          so an orange border would appear around the field:
        </p>
        <code>
          input[type=email]:invalid { <br />
          background: orange; }
        </code>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>: disabled</h2>
        <p>
          The :disabled pseudo-class targets a form element in the disabled
          state. An element in a disabled state can’t be selected, checked or
          activated or gain focus.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>: empty</h2>
        <p>
          The :empty pseudo-class targets elements that have no content in them
          of any kind at all. If an element has a letter, another HTML element
          or even a space, then that element would not be empty. Empty stands
          for no content or characters would appear in an element. An HTML
          comment inside an element does not count as content in this case.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>:enabled</h2>
        <p>
          The :enabled pseudo-class targets elements that are enabled. All form
          elements are enabled by default — that is, until we add the disabled
          attribute to the element in the markup. It can be used as combination
          of :enabled and :disabled to provide visual feedback, thus improving
          the user experience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>:in-range</h2>
        <p>
          The :in-range pseudo-class targets elements that have a range and
          whose values are within the defined range.
          <br />
          As an example, the range can be defined as in between 5 and 10: Values
          inside this range create a green border.
          <br />
          :in range =green <br />
          :out of range =red <br />

          If you type 555 and border color turns red. Type 8 and border color
          turns green.(in range)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>: indeterminate</h2>
        <p>
          The :indeterminate pseudo-class targets input elements such as radio
          buttons and check boxes that are not selected or that are unselected
          upon the page loading. An example of this is when a page loads with a
          group of radio buttons and no default or preselected radio button has
          been set, or when a checkbox has been given the indeterminate state
          via JavaScript.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>: Valid</h2>
        <p>
          The :valid pseudo-class targets a form element whose formatting is
          correct according to that element’s required format. In the following
          example, the email input field has a correctly formatted email
          structure; so, the field would be considered valid and would appear
          with a 1-pixel green border:
        </p>
        <code>
          input[type=email]:valid { <br />
          border: 1px solid green; }
        </code>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>:read-only</h2>
        <p>
          The :read-only pseudo-class targets an element that
          cannot be edited by the user. It’s similar to the :disabled
          pseudo-class; the attribute used in the markup would determine which
          pseudo-class we should use. This would be useful, for example, in a
          form where we need to show pre-populated information that cannot be
          altered but that still needs to be displayed within the form element
          for submission purposes. In the following example, the input element
          has a readonly HTML attribute. So, it can be targeted with the
          :read-only pseudo-class, which we will use to give it gray text.
        </p>
          <br>
          <code>
           HTML: <br>
           &#60;input type="text" value="I am read only" readonly&#62;
            </code> <br>
            CSS: <br>
            input:read-only { color: gray; }
            <code>
        
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
